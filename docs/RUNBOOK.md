# Unified Runtime Runbook

Updated: 2026-10-05 (`main`).

## Start and health

```bash
npm ci
npm start
```

The process must open one listener on `PORT || 3000`.

- `/ping` proves the HTTP listener is alive.
- `/ping` is the Render host-liveness probe. `/health` is the combined-readiness response for MongoDB, Discord
  slash-command registration, voice, and verification. A 503 during startup is
  expected; persistent 503 requires investigation.
- `/ready` is an alias of the same combined-readiness response.

Expected boot order in logs:

```text
HTTP listener
MongoDB connection and state load
initial verification migration, history, snapshot, retention, reveal, and OAuth maintenance
Discord login
command registration, panel restore, and Voice auto-resume
ready
```

## Deployment

### inwcloud

```text
Custom command: npm ci && npm start
Internal port: PORT, otherwise 3000
```

Generate one domain for that port. Set `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` to its canonical HTTPS
origin and register `https://DOMAIN/auth/callback` in Discord Developer Portal.

### Render

Sync the single root service from `render.yaml`. Render uses `/ping` as the listener-only liveness check. Monitoring should use
`/ready` (or the compatibility `/health` alias) for combined MongoDB, Discord,
voice, slash-command, and verification readiness.

## Pre-release/deployment

1. Back up MongoDB and confirm restore access.
2. Register the unified OAuth callback URI.
3. Copy required secrets into the unified service.
4. Set the 16 owner-maintained values from `.env.example`, including `OWNER_ID`
   as one or more comma-separated Owner Discord User IDs. `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` is
   canonical. If legacy URL aliases still exist in the host configuration,
   keep them equal or remove them.
5. If historical admin grants must refresh against the retired URI, set
   `LEGACY_ADMIN_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI`.
6. Keep `ENCRYPTION_KEY` stable for AES migration. Keep both
   `ENCRYPTION_KEY` and `API_SECRET` stable for IP/device correlation unless a
   coordinated correlation migration or re-verification is planned. Rotating
   `API_SECRET` invalidates existing Owner sessions.
7. Mount persistent volume storage for the local SQLite operational database
   (e.g. `/persistent`) and set `SQLITE_DB_PATH=/persistent/discordbot.sqlite`,
   `SQLITE_BACKUP_DIR=/persistent/backups`,
   `SQLITE_ASSET_DIR=/persistent/cache-assets`, and
   `SQLITE_PERSISTENCE_CONFIRMED=true`. Run `npm run check:storage`
   to verify filesystem write permissions, path isolation, and persistence confirmation before deployment.
8. Deploy.
9. Run the single-port smoke helper:

   ```bash
   SMOKE_ALLOWED_HOSTS=DOMAIN npm run smoke:unified -- https://DOMAIN
   ```

10. Test Owner Dashboard, `/verification`, a target guild page, and a complete
   member verification.
11. If a legacy standalone service still exists, stop it only after all checks
   pass. New/current installations have only the root service.

## Verification smoke test

1. Login through Owner PIN at `/`.
2. Open the Dashboard navigation item `สมาชิก → ยืนยันตัวตน`; confirm every bot
   guild is selectable, including a guild not present in Approved Guild records.
3. Open `/verification/:guildId`; confirm Overview, System, Panel, Policy/Role,
   and Verification Data stay inside the purple Owner Dashboard shell.
4. Validate/send or update a verification panel and return to the guild chooser.
5. In a test member account, authorize the callback.
6. Confirm:
   - callback POST succeeds;
   - existing member or `guilds.join` path works;
   - target role is assigned;
   - profile, connections, guild list, target-member, browser, network,
     join/role result, and data-quality metadata are persisted;
   - raw token/IP is absent from public and unauthenticated APIs.
7. Open a verified user's “ดูข้อมูลทั้งหมด”, confirm the authenticated Owner
   view returns Token, raw IP, and full detail directly without a repeated PIN,
   reason field, or separate reveal action.

## Voice Admin staging validation

Use an isolated MongoDB database and a small Discord test guild. Do not use a
production member list for this validation.

1. Apply Mute and Deafen locks from the Voice Admin panel, then inspect the
   corresponding lock records in the staging database. Confirm each lock has
   the intended member, type, actor, timestamp, and version.
2. Restart the bot, rejoin a locked member to the test voice channel, and
   confirm the lock is applied again.
3. Exercise the Owner text controls and the Administrator panel controls for
   disconnect, move, mute, deafen, and unlock. Verify their Administrator and
   Owner targeting rules separately.
4. Confirm a normal Administrator can release a normal lock, while an
   Owner-forced mute remains enforced until a configured Owner releases it.
5. Temporarily remove one required bot voice permission in the test channel.
   Confirm the command reports a permission failure and that a durable lock is
   rolled back instead of being left behind after a failed Discord action.
6. Use medium and large test channels to confirm bulk work remains bounded to
   eight member operations per guild and twelve across the process.
7. Trigger one controlled staging database failure, then inspect the private
   alert. It must identify the operation and bounded error code without token,
   connection URI, or other secret values.

## Migration

Migration runs automatically in bounded batches after MongoDB connects and
continues during hourly maintenance. Check
`/api/verification/diagnostics` under `automaticMigration`. Manual dry-run is:

```bash
npm run migrate:verification
```

Manual apply remains available for maintenance:

```bash
npm run migrate:verification -- --apply
```

The script should report counts only. It must not print document bodies, tokens,
or IP values. It is additive and does not delete fields/collections.

Inspect or restore an automatically archived original document:

For `--apply`, first stop the bot runtime so all OAuth and verification writes
remain paused until the restore command finishes.

```bash
npm run restore:verification -- --source-id=OAUTH_USER_DOCUMENT_ID
npm run restore:verification -- --source-id=OAUTH_USER_DOCUMENT_ID --apply --maintenance-confirmed
# Only after confirming that newer live OAuth data may be overwritten:
npm run restore:verification -- --source-id=OAUTH_USER_DOCUMENT_ID --apply --force --maintenance-confirmed
```

The first restore command changes nothing. This archive is in the same MongoDB
database and is intended for migration rollback, not whole-database disaster
recovery.

## Common failures

### `/health` or `/ready` remains degraded

- Check `dbConnected`, `botOnline`, `commandsReady`, `voiceReady`, and
  `verificationReady`.
- If database is false, inspect `MONGO_URI`, network allow-list, and MongoDB
  availability.
- If verification is false, inspect the safe maintenance summary and OAuth
  client/crypto configuration.
- If bot/voice is false, inspect bot token, intents, Discord availability, and
  voice diagnostics.

### OAuth redirect mismatch

- Confirm Developer Portal URI exactly matches
  `https://DOMAIN/auth/callback`.
- Confirm `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` uses the same scheme/host and has no extra path.
- Remove stale legacy URL aliases, or keep them exactly equal to the canonical
  origin while compatibility is still required.
- Restart after changing environment variables because callback constants are
  initialized at process start.

### OAuth code expired or already used

This is expected for replayed/old codes. Press the Discord panel again and use
the new authorization flow. Never retry the same raw code server-side or log it.

### Guild join fails

- Confirm the grant includes `guilds.join`.
- Confirm the bot is in the target guild.
- Confirm client ID/secret and bot token belong to the same application.
- Confirm the target guild ID in signed state/config is correct.
- Role assignment must not run after join failure.

### Role assignment fails

- Confirm the role exists.
- Confirm bot permissions and role hierarchy.
- Confirm target member now exists in the guild.
- Inspect the persisted safe `joinResult` and `roleAssignResult`.

### Optional data fetch fails

Check `snapshotMeta`/`dataQuality` status and redacted failure code. A failed
connections/guild/member fetch must leave the last successful `OAuthUser`
snapshot intact.

For chunked snapshots, confirm `complete: true`, verify
`returnedCount === storedCount`, and check `chunkCount`. Pagination in the Owner
Dashboard changes only the displayed page; Member Detail reads all finalized
chunks and does not treat pagination as truncation.

### Voice Session shows no account or server data

An invalid or undecryptable stored Voice token is terminal. On the next login/
auto-resume attempt the runtime marks that record failed, removes it from active
Dashboard cards, and does not keep retrying it as an online Session. Start a new
Session with a valid token. Dashboard stop is idempotent, so a record already
removed by cleanup is reported as stopped instead of returning a false failure.

### Dashboard memory differs from the host panel

The Dashboard RAM card is process RSS: resident memory of the Node process. The
status detail reports V8 heap used/allocated separately. A hosting panel may add
container/runtime overhead, so its number can be higher without either reading
being false.

### Raw IP is missing

- Normal and public APIs intentionally return null.
- In the authenticated Owner Member Detail view, raw IP is returned directly
  with Token and full detail; no reason or separate reveal action is required.
- If full detail returns no IP, the selected user has no verification log with
  an encrypted source IP.
- Never add temporary logging of decrypted IP.

### Historical admin OAuth refresh fails

Set `LEGACY_ADMIN_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI` to the exact URI used when the old grant
was issued. No new admin OAuth route exists.

## Validation before release

```bash
npm ci --no-audit --no-fund
npm run check
npm test
npm run check:coverage
npm audit --audit-level=high
```

Also run an approved secret scan and inspect `git diff --check`. Confirm the
protected-path guard verifies the complete seven-file manifest and its digests;
also confirm that `git diff` contains no unreviewed protected file or boot/import
change.

## Rollback

1. Do not run destructive MongoDB cleanup.
2. Keep the backup and old deployment configuration until unified smoke tests
   pass.
3. If rollback is required, route traffic/callback to the known working
   artifact and restore its matching canonical `PUBLIC_BASE_URL`.
4. Additive schema fields can remain; old readers should ignore them.
5. Do not roll back encryption keys separately from encrypted records.
6. Record the failure and safe diagnostics without secrets.

## Owner-approved self-client dependency

`discord.js-selfbot-v13` is an intentional and necessary dependency of the isolated Voice account/session subsystem. The repository owner has explicitly approved its continued use because the current architecture has no compatible replacement that preserves the required behavior.

Do not remove, replace, migrate, rename, independently upgrade/downgrade, or convert its library-specific APIs unless the repository owner gives a new explicit instruction for that exact change. Main-bot Discord.js v14 work must remain isolated from the self-client package. See [`docs/SELF_CLIENT_POLICY.md`](SELF_CLIENT_POLICY.md) for the binding maintenance policy.
